# OS-Lab-2019

Dear Viewer ,
Hi.

Here I add all the files and codes that I am asked by the TA in OS Lab Course.

This course is taught by Mr.Mohammad Mostafaee (@mmd-mostafaee) @Shiraz University 



# Session 1

We are told to write a program that runs multiple times with mutiple number of threads in order to add the elements of an integer array.
The goal of this task is only to monitor the effect of multi-threading on the OS and it's resources.
We were ought to write our results in a text file and show the minimum and average time for each time.
As we can see, The ideal number of threads for each task depends on the size of out integer array.
Semaphore and locking on a variable was not our main concern here and that's why we have ignored the critical section made by using the same variable for all of threads which causes mutual exclusion phenomenon.
